# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
This work was carried out as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technologies, under the Machine Learning domain.

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective linear regression model that can:
- Learn from a dataset of houses with known prices.
- Predict the price of a house given its:
  -  Square footage
  -  Number of bedrooms
  -  Number of bathrooms

# Data Preparation
The original dataset contained multiple features. However, as the task specifically focuses on predicting the Sale Price based on:

- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms

...all other columns were excluded from the analysis. The model was trained using only these three relevant features to maintain clarity and task alignment.

train.csv was used for training the model.
test.csv was used to generate predictions.
The predicted results were saved along with their respective IDs in a file named submission.csv.
